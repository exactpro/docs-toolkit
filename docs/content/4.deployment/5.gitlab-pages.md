# 4. GitLab pages

To deploy your website using GitLab pages, create project for your docs website based on this template and follow [official guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started/pages_ui.html) to configure GitLab CLI.

You need to store static files in artifacts of your GitLab project and then configure pages to host static files from artifacts.

Visit [official guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html) to find more details about GitLab CI configuration.

GitLab CLI configuration example:

```yaml
image: node:16
stages:
  - build
build-docs:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx nuxt generate
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/*
```

You probably need to configure prefix for your website, visit [customization page](/customization) for details.
