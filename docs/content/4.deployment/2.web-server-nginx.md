#  Web-server 

While in project directory, use `npm run generate` command do get html files, that you will place to your server via SSH or any other way.
All generated files located in two directories:

- `dist`
- `.output/public`

::notice{note}

Remember: you need to configure CI/CD to automatically get new html files every time content changed.

::

Use static hosting instructions for your web-server to configure it properly ([NGINX web server instructions](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)).
