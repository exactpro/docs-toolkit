# 2. Term

## Term

**Term component** (`components/content/Term.vue`) is displayed like an underlined word, but it also can create popup with its definition.

To see definition, hover the term. To close popup, click outside or move mouse outside the popup window and wait.

### Terms definitions

All terms definitions should be created as `.md` files in `content/_terms` directory of a project.

Term definition should contain `title` or `alias` to be fetched in popup.

- `title`: string - name of the term (if not defined explicitly, first level header will become title)
- `alias`: list of strings - additional spellings of the term

Example of term with:

- `title`: `Participant`
- `alias`: `null`

```md
# Participant

An account that initiates transfer of funds through the Payment Service Provider (PSP)
```

Example of term with:

- `title`: `Business network operator (BNO)`
- `alias`: `Business network operator`, `Business Network Operator`, `business network operator`, `BNO`

```md
---
title: Example
alias: [Example term, Test, Test term, Placeholder]
---
# Example term


It is a test term to be displayed.
Feel free to add terms that will help your reader with understanding of page content to content-terms directory!

It is also good to add link (for example, to some external docs, articles) [like this](https://example.com/) if needed
```

### Usage

Use [inline MDC syntax](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/mdc#inline-components):

- inside `[]` specify text, which should be displayed in content
- inside `{}` specify `term` property for to search term definition by it title or alias

```md
As a good developer I always leave some :term[example]{term="Test term"} to make my code clear
```

Result:

As a good developer I always leave some :term[example]{term="Test term"} to make my code clear

::notice{note}

Remember: you need to restart your website if term content was changed to make sure, that everything is in place
